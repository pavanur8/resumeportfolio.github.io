        <h3><u>DAVANAGERE CYCLING CLUB</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>It is social interaction tool to act as bridge between the cyclists and
            admin .DAVANAGERE CYCLING CLUB motto is to pomote cycling
            and creating awareness regarding cycling
            </p></li>

    <h3><u>EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION MODEL USING MACHINE LEARNING</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>This project proposes the use of a linear regression model for earthquake prediction by analyzing seismic data. The model captures the linear relationship between input features and
            earthquake occurrences, such as magnitude, depth, and location.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>the model is trained using gradient descent. Evaluation metrics demonstrate the model's strong correlation and accurate
            estimation of earthquake probabilities. The simplicity and
            interpretability of the linear regression model make it practical for
            implementation and decision-making in earthquake prediction
            </p></li>
